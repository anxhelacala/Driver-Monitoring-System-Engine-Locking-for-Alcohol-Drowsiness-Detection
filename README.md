Driver Monitoring System Engine Locking for Alcohol Drowsiness Detection
 
This project presents a low-cost Driver Monitoring System (DMS) aimed at enhancing road safety by reducing accidents caused by alcohol consumption and driver drowsiness. The system integrates components such as an alcohol sensor (MQ-3), an IR sensor, an Arduino Uno, a motor driver, a DC motor, and an LCD. It monitors the driver's condition and provides notifications of potential risks. In critical cases, the system can automatically shut down the engine to prevent unsafe driving.
